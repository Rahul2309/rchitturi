                Years ago, it was raining hard. My friend was shuffling into a
                Starbucks when she saw a man behind her. She held the door for
                him. He saw her and stopped, grinning as she rain drenched her
                clothes. “Are you coming in?” she said. The man just stood
                there, chuckling. “No, I’m going to watch you get soaked for
                being so stupid.” He spent the rest of the time in line, mocking
                her. “I bet you’re one of those bleeding heart liberals,” he
                kept saying. She ignored him. What else could she do? These
                kinds of little moments stick in my memory over the years,
                because they shed so much light on America. This one’s a perfect

                Image for post Evan El-Amin My brother-in-law leaves his keys in
                the ignition at night. “Who in the world would want to steal my
                car?” I tell him, “Someone who doesn’t have one? Someone who
                would chop it up and sell the parts for cash?” He laughs. This
                is my family in a nutshell. It tells you a lot about America,
                and especially white people. It doesn’t matter what our politics
                are. A lot of us just can’t imagine anything bad ever happening.
                Half my family can’t be bothered to think about current events
                at all. They don’t recycle. The rest of them definitely voted
                for Trump. I did my best to convince them, and it wasn’t enough.
                Some of them don’t even understand why we’re staying home for
                Christmas this year, instead of driving 12 hours
